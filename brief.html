					Frameworks are allowed however bonus points if you don't use frameworks</p>
					<br/><br/>

					<h2>Level 1 - Delete the rows</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Upon clicking the delete button the row should be removed. This should remove the character from the game</li>
					</ul>
					<br/><br/>

					<h2>Level 2 - Increase HP</h2>

					<h2>Level 4 - Roll those dice</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>When clicking the 'Roll Dice Button' generate two random numbers between 1 and 6</li>
						<li>Display both of the numbers in alert/modal</li>
						<li>When a double is rolled display 'Special Powers Activated' in the alert/modal</li>
						<li>Store the dice rolls and record if the special powers are activated in a object that can be accessed in the next challenge</li>
					</ul>
					<br/><br/>

					<h2>Level 5 - Display Special Powers</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Create 6 special powers</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Double 1 = Increases health to 100</li>

					</ul>
					<br/>

					<h2>Building a fighting game (Part 3) - May 2020</h2>
					<p>In this challenge you will be starting the fight, processing the special powers and displaying the winner.</p>
					<p>You can mix PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.</p>
					<p>Frameworks are allowed however bonus points if you don't use frameworks</p><br/>
					<p><em>Please note that there is no health or strength cap however if the health is 0 the player should be removed from the game.</em></p>
					<br/><br/>

					<h2>Level 1 - Pair up</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Randomly pair fighters together</li>
						<li>A creature can only have one opponent per fight.</li>
						<li>Create a column which holds the opponents name.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>There will be fighters who do not have an opponent due to an odd number of fighters</li>
						</ul>
						<li>If there is an odd number please ensure that the special powers are still processed</li>
					</ul>
					<br/><br/>

					<h2>Level 2 - Distribute the special powers</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Randomly distribute the special powers across the creatures</li>
						<li>Only one special power is allowed per creature</li>
						<li>Display the special power in the 'Special Power' column</li>
					</ul>
					<br/><br/>

					<h2>Level 3 - Process the special powers</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Adjust the HP, strength and remove creatures from the brawl where necessary</li>
						<li>Once the opponents have been paired randomly select which opponent uses their special power first</li>
						<li>Remove players who have a health of zero.</li>
					</ul>
					<br/><br/>

					<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p><br/>
					<p>A double 2 was rolled</p><br/>

					<p>Opponent A starts with a health of 200</p>
					<p>Opponent B starts with a health of 250</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Opponent A = Increases health by 100</li>
						<li>Opponent B =  Decreases their opponents health by 100</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<p><strong>Result</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Opponent A having no change to health. It would still be 200</li>
					</ul>
					<br/><br/>

					<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p><br/>
					<p>A double 5 was rolled</p><br/>
					<ul>
						<li>Opponent A = Decreases their strength between 1 - 100</li>
						<li>Opponent B =  Hides (Skips a go)</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<p><strong>Result</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Opponent A would have a reduction of health between 1 - 100</li>
						<li>The fight would not happen because opponent B is hidden</li>
					</ul>
					<br/><br/>

					<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p><br/>
					<p>A double 6 was rolled</p><br/>
					<ul>
						<li>Opponent A = Steals 50% of the strength from opponent B</li>
						<li>Opponent B = Increases their strength between 1 - 100</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<p><strong>Result</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Opponent B would gain an increase of strength between 1 - 100</li>
						<li>Opponent A would gain 50% of the Opponent B's health</li>
					</ul>
					<br/><br/>

					<h2>Level 4 - Fight!</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>After the special powers have been processed randomly decided which opponent will strike first</li>
						<li>Subtract the sum of the strength plus the dice roll from the opponents health</li>
						<li>If the opponents health has been reduced to zero then remove that opponent from the game</li>
						<li>Repeat for the second opponent</li>
					</ul>
					<br/><br/>

					<h2>Level 5 - Display the winner!</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Keep rolling the dice until you get a winner</li>
						<li>Show that winner in the modal/alert</li>
					</ul>
					<br/><br/>

					<h2>Level master</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Don't use any frameworks!</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Additional queries</h2>
					<p>There are two scenarios where a special power could be issued and not used, which are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A creature is given a special power and is also deemed to be the odd numbered creature and is exempted from that round</li>
						<li>The creature is given a special power, but the opponent goes first and plays the special power of 'Hide'</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<p>A) Yep that's correct. If the player doesn't have an opponent then skip that players go and skip that players powers.</p>
					<br/><br/>
					<p>Consider the following scenario:</p><br/>

					<p>Opponent A Strength 50 Health 20<br/>
					Vs.<br/>
					Opponent B Strength 60 Health 30</p><br/>

					<p>Dice thrown 5 + 3</p>
					<p>Therefore no special powers are applied</p><br/>

					<p>Opponent A strikes first</p>
					<p>Opponent B takes a hit of (Opponent A's strength 50 + dice roll total 8)</p>
					<p>Therefore Opponent B loses a health score of 58 (50 + 8)</p><br/>
					<p>Opponent B started the round with only 30 health points, so is eliminated.</p><br/>

					<p>At this stage, Opponent B has not struck Opponent A to cause any damage.</p>
					<p>Will this mean that as there has been no strike, Opponent A will not lose health in that round?.</p><br/>

					<p>A) Yes, that is correct.</p>

					<h2>Additional functionality added outside of the challenge brief</h2>
	
					<p><strong>Game Mechanics</strong></p>

					</ul>
					<br/>
