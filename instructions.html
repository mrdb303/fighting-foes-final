					<h2>Game overview</h2>
			
					<p>100 creatures are paired up and are fighting. Creatures can be 
					eliminated within these battles if their health score reaches zero. 
					Remaining creatures continue with the pairing up and fighting process 
					until only one creature remains. The remaining creature is deemed the winner.</p><br/>
					<p>There are four creature types: witches, dragons, snakes and river 
					trolls.</p><br/>
			
					<p>Each creature is generated at random using the following strength 
					and health ranges:</p><br/><br/>
			
					<p><strong>Witches</strong></p>
					<img class="char" src="images/witch.png" alt="Witch image" />
					
					<ul>
						<li>Strength between 60 - 80</li>
						<li>Health between 50 - 60</li>
					</ul>

					<br/><br/>
					<p><strong>Dragons</strong></p>
					<img class="char" src="images/dragon.png" alt="Dragon image" />

					<ul>
						<li>Strength between 80 - 90</li>
						<li>Health between 80 - 90</li>
					</ul>
			
					<br/><br/>
					<p><strong>Snakes</strong></p>
					<img class="char" src="images/snake.png" alt="Snake image" />

					<ul>
						<li>Strength between 30 - 60</li>
						<li>Health between 30 - 90</li>
					</ul>

					<br/><br/>
					<p><strong>River Trolls</strong></p>
					<img class="char" src="images/troll.png" alt="River Troll image" />
			
					<ul>
						<li>Strength between 22 - 65</li>
						<li>Health between 60 - 92</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Instructions</h2>
			
					<p>The game is controlled at random by rolling a pair of dice, by 
					clicking on the &#39;Roll the Dice&#39; button.</p><br/>
					<img class="mode" src="images/roll_dice.png" alt="Roll the Dice image" />
			
				</section>
			
				<section>
					<h2>Stage 1 - Roll Dice mode</h2>
			
					<p>Once the dice has been rolled, the table will update to show 
					opponents and stats. Underneath the table will be the respective 
					matchups.</p><br/>
					<p>If there are no doubles rolled, then the code will jump past the 
					next stage direct to stage 3 - fight mode.</p>
				</section>
			
				<section>
					<h2>Stage 2 - Process Power mode</h2>
			
					<p>If there are doubles rolled, then the game will apply at random the powers 
					issued. The table will also show the powers generated for the respective creature.
					Where the matchups are shown underneath the table, the powers will also be 
					displayed there too.</p><br/>
			
					<p>Pressing the &#39;Process Power&#39; button will apply the powers to the 
					creature table and amend the creature stats accordingly.</p><br/> 

					<img class="mode" src="images/process_power.png" alt="Process Power image" />
					
					<br/><br/><p>Underneath the table you will see the actual power stats that have been 
					applied. For example, a power could be &#39;Increases strength between 1 - 100&#39;. 
					In this circumstance the summary will show the actual strength value 
					applied (i.e. 56 if that is the random value generated).</p><br/>
			
					<p>Also shown is the calculated value of the health points that will be lost 
					if the fight completes. Note that there are cases which will mean that the 
					opponent will not lose additional health points, such as:</p><br/>
			
					<ul>
						<li>Creature skips a go through gaining the &#39;Hide/Skip a go&#39; power</li>
						<li>Creature has been eliminated due to the result of special powers being applied</li>
						<li>Creature being defeated before it gets an attack (i.e. if its health is at zero 
						from the first strike of its opponent, when it is second in line to attack)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Stage 3 - Fight mode</h2>
			
					<p>Pressing the &#39;Fight&#39; button will initiate the battle between 
					paired up creatures.</p><br/>
					<img class="mode" src="images/fight.png" alt="Fight button image" /><br/>
					<br/><p>The battle commences in the correct fighting order. The creature 
					going first performs the first strike and health points are lost by 
					the opponent. To calculate health points lost, add the 
					creature&#39;s strength who is attacking to the sum of the dice. If 
					the opponent is left with health points greater than zero, then the 
					opponent will strike and cause the first fighter to lose health 
					points. If a creature is reduced to zero health points, then it is 
					eliminated.</p><br/>
			
					<p>When the stage is over, the page will update the main table and 
					list the creatures that were eliminated in that round.</p><br/>
			
					<p>If one creature remains, then the battle is over and the trophy 
					and medal are displayed. At this stage you can press the reset 
					button to restart the game.</p><br/>
					<p>If more than one creature remains, then the game continues with 
					the remaining creatures and goes back to stage one for the next 
					fighting round.</p>

					<h2>Additional Information</h2>
			
					<p>A special power only lasts for one fighting round.</p><br/>
			
					<p>If there are an odd number of creatures, then a creature will be 
					picked at random to not participate in the round of fighting. If 
					this creature has been granted a special power, then it will not be 
					processed.</p><br>
			
					<p>The action buttons are available for creature modification 
					throughout the duration of the game(delete creature/add health/remove health).</p><br/> 
					<img src="images/action_buttons.png" alt="Action buttons image" 
					height="50px" width="123px"/><br/>
					<br/><p>Once the winner is announced the action buttons for 
					creature modification will become greyed out. Clicking the action 
					buttons at this stage will have no effect.</p><br/>
					<img src="images/action_buttons_grey.png" alt="Action buttons grey image" 
					height="50px" width="123px"/><br/><br/>
					<p>The game is reset by clicking the reset button 
					or reloading the page.</p>
